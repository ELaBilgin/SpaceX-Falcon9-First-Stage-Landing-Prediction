# SpaceX-Falcon9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction


his IBM Applied Data Science project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX promotes its Falcon 9 rocket launches at a price of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers, which charge over $165 million per launch. This cost advantage primarily comes from SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By accurately predicting whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate the overall launch cost, which is valuable for potential competitors looking to bid against SpaceX.
